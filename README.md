# Simon Says Game

This is a web-based version of the classic Simon Says game, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Play
The game generates a sequence of colors, and your goal is to repeat the sequence in the correct order. Each round, a new color is added to the sequence, making it progressively more challenging. See how many rounds you can complete!
